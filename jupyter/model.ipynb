    "# Problem Statement\n",
    "With the dramatic growth of computer networks usage and the huge increase in the number of applications running on top of it, network security is becoming increasingly while the all the systems suffers from security vulnerabilities, which could increase the attacks that could negatively affects the economy.\n",
    "Therefore detecting vulnerabilities in the system in the network has been more important and need to be done as accurate as possible in real time.\n",
    "in this notebook a model will be created and trained using SVM classifier to distengush if there is an attack or not in the network packet.\n",
    "\n",

    "## Intrusion detection systems\n",
    "* Host-Based IDS (HIDS): A host-based IDS is deployed on a particular endpoint and designed to protect it against internal and external threats. Such an IDS may have the ability to monitor network traffic to and from the machine, observe running processes, and inspect the system’s logs. A host-based IDS’s visibility is limited to its host machine, decreasing the available context for decision-making, but has deep visibility into the host computer’s internals.\n",
    "* Network-Based IDS (NIDS): A network-based IDS solution is designed to monitor an entire protected network. It has visibility into all traffic flowing through the network and makes determinations based upon packet metadata and contents. This wider viewpoint provides more context and the ability to detect widespread threats; however, these systems lack visibility into the internals of the endpoints that they protect.\n",
    "\n",
    "Detection Method of IDS:\n",
    "\n",
    "* Signature-based Method:\n",
    "Signature-based IDS detects the attacks on the basis of the specific patterns such as number of bytes or number of 1’s or number of 0’s in the network traffic. It also detects on the basis of the already known malicious instruction sequence that is used by the malware. The detected patterns in the IDS are known as signatures.\n",
    "Signature-based IDS can easily detect the attacks whose pattern (signature) already exists in system but it is quite difficult to detect the new malware attacks as their pattern (signature) is not known.\n",
    "\n",
    "* Anomaly-based Method:\n",
    "Anomaly-based IDS was introduced to detect unknown malware attacks as new malware are developed rapidly. In anomaly-based IDS there is use of machine learning to create a trustful activity model and anything coming is compared with that model and it is declared suspicious if it is not found in model. Machine learning-based method has a better-generalized property in comparison to signature-based IDS as these models can be trained according to the applications and hardware configurations."
